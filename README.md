# mrcat-pixel-firefox-css
 A Firefox CSS config for personal use I've been tweaking over the past year.

 ![Screenshot example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrcat-pixel/mrcat-pixel-firefox-css/main/screenshot.png)

 Requires Tree Style Tabs, the CSS config for the addon is in ``treeStyleTabs.css``

 Some style rules found around the web, some written by me.
